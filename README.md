# 📸 Photobooth-app on Windows with Python 🐍

## ⚒️ PLEASE READ THIS ⚙️

Since photobooth-app was updated to version 6.0.0, a new document for this repository hasn't been prepared yet. If you want to see a previous version 4.0.0, I have already created a branch named "photobooth-app-4.0.0." I will update it this year. Thank you for your attention. Enjoy your day!
